# My Portfolio Version 4
This version will enable a few features:

Will add all previous Portfolio versions (with updated names and files linked and shared here)
Will enable seamless switching and viewing (the websites will be linked in such a way where itll take you to that verion - as it was then, with the eception of a home button and styles changing)
Will add one other project - The First Website Created (Under my website Development class, with changes to look polished and finished)
Add a comments/advice section on all (old versions and first website), and have it stored as well.
